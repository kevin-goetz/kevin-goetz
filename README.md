## Hi there, I'm Kevin 👋
I'm a Data Scientist based in Hamburg, Germany
& curious to learn new things!  
  
  
### Me in OOP:

```python
class KevinG:

    def __init__(self):
        self.username = 'keving'
        self.name = 'Kevin Götz'
        self.linkedin = 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/kgötz'
        self.code = {
            'Python': ['Pandas', 'scikit-learn', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib', 'Folium', 'SQLite3', 'Requests', 'BeatifulSoup', 'etc.'],
            'SQL': ['PostgreSQL', 'MS SQL', 'Standard SQL'],
        }
        self.rdbms = ['AWS Redshift Microsoft', 'SQL Server', 'Oracle']
        self.agile = ['Jira', 'Confluence']
        self.experience = ['Market Research', 'Business Intelligence', 'Sports & Economics']

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name


if __name__ == '__main__':
    me = KevinG()

```  
  
  
### :eyes: More about me:

- 🌱 I studied Sports & Economics but that doesn't hold me back to learn new things like coding.  
      Mark Twain said it best: **“Don't let schooling interfere with your education.”**
      
- :star: Strengths: being curious, listening carefully, following my interests and learning continuously.
      
- 👯 I’m looking to apply my skills in a new company in Hamburg, Germany (I relocated). Hit me up! :point_down:
